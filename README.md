# tic-tac-toe-javafx
## description
This is a GUI Tic-Tac-Toe game written in Java using JavaFX. It has 3 different game modes. a user can play with a computer, another person locally, or another person on another computer.

## Purpose
This project will help me integrate my knowledge of javaFX and networked applications in Java. I want to experiment with some interesting parts of javaFX like having multiple windows on the screen at once. I also want to create a networked game from scratch using user input to determine host and port instead of right when it is run.

## Design Patterns
### Peer to Peer networked model
### Model View Proxy networked model
